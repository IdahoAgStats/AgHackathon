We invite you to sign up to work together towards solving the biggest challenges in agriculture. Our agricultural challenges require inquisitive and creative minds to develop new and effective solutions. We invite you to take up this challenge.\nThis is a team competition open to all graduate students across the ASA, CSSA and SSSA. This competition offers cash prizes of $400 for first place, $300 for second place and $200 for third place. These prizes are awarded per person regardless of team size. We gratefully acknowledge and thank the Hackathon sponsor who has made this prize money possible, Syngenta Seeds."

We recommend a balanced team with regard to domain expertise and skills set. We also recommend that between the team members, there is expertise for (1) data curation, (2) data analysis, and (3) data visualization, but there is flexibility in this realm. Not every single person on the team needs to be accomplished in everything.

If data are behind a paywall, they are not available sufficiently public for this competition. Data requiring an permissions such as API key are public so long as this is a free resource that anyone can obtain. The appropriateness of the data source to the questions each teams focuses on is part of the judging criteria (see the judging rubric for more information).\nTeams may consult any resources regarding their work, including peer reviewed literature and other professionals in the field. When consulting with individuals, please do not abuse this. Other folks can give insight and advice, but they should not be coding anything, producing any outputs, providing the central ideas, or otherwise acting in a leadership capacity. This is a time for students to shine.\nStudents are also welcome to use any statistical software, programming language, data visualization and graphical software they want to accomplish their aims.\nAfter the topic is unveiled, teams may work on this topic at their discretion from the unveiling up until their final presentation."

This will be evaluated based on what is placed on a dedicated public git repository on a git cloud hosting service (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). Teams are not required to use git or a git hosting service for collaboration; they are only required to upload their final processes to public git hosting service.\nInvolving all team members in the final presentation is encouraged, but it is not required.
