People or teams who are virtual attendees may compete (but each person must be registered for the meetings).\nTeams can be formed independently or you may put your name in as a ‘free agent’ to be paired with other free agents.\nThere are no rules on team composition. We recommend a balanced team with regard to domain expertise and skills set. We also recommend that between the team members, there is expertise for (1) data curation, (2) data analysis, and (3) data visualization, but there is flexibility in this realm. Not every single person on the team needs to be accomplished in everything. This is a team competition, after all.\nAll team members must register by the deadline: August 31, 2023, midnight (Pacific Time Zone)."

Teams are neither penalized nor rewarded for using data sources outside of those we introduce, but these data sources must be available to everyone. If data are behind a paywall, they are not available sufficiently public for this competition. Data requiring an permissions such as API key are public so long as this is a free resource that anyone can obtain. The appropriateness of the data source to the questions each teams focuses on is part of the judging criteria (see the judging rubric for more information).\nTeams may consult any resources regarding their work, including peer reviewed literature and other professionals in the field. When consulting with individuals, please do not abuse this. Other folks can give insight and advice, but they should not be coding anything, producing any outputs, providing the central ideas, or otherwise acting in a leadership capacity. This is a time for students to shine.\nStudents are also welcome to use any statistical software, programming language, data visualization and graphical software they want to accomplish their aims.\nAfter the topic is unveiled, teams may work on this topic at their discretion from the unveiling up until their final presentation."

Judging will be based on what is presented only.\nThe only exception to the previous rule is regarding transparency of each team’s work. This will be evaluated based on what is placed on a dedicated public git repository on a git cloud hosting service (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). Teams are not required to use git or a git hosting service for collaboration; they are only required to upload their final processes to public git hosting service.\nInvolving all team members in the final presentation is encouraged, but it is not required. Team balance of the final presentation will have no impact the team score. Teams which do not present automatically forfeit.\nJudging will be conducted by 3 to 5 experts following the judging rubric.\nAwards will be based on the top 3 point scorers. In the event of ties, the judges will decide through consensus."
